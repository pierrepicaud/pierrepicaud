👋 Hi, I’m @pierrepicaud, a CS graduate with a deep interest in biogerontology. Outside of tech, I enjoy working out in the gym and delving into foreign languages.

🌟 Currently, I'm enhancing my skills in DevOps as a Tech Support at [Soramitsu](https://soramitsu.co.jp/). My journey includes experiences like being a DevOps intern at [Provectus](https://provectus.com/), a machine learning intern, and even a stint in 3D modeling.

🔍 My technical expertise spans a variety of domains, making me a versatile asset in any tech team.

🗣️ Languages I speak: Vietnamese, English, Chinese.
